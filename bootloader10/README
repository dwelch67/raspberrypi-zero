See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

This example is for the pi zero, see other directories for other flavors
of raspberry pi.

This is a very simple bootloader.  Instead of the sd dance (see
top level README), this makes life a bit simpler and greatly reduces
physical wear and tear on the sd card socket.  Do the sd card dance one
more time with this kernel.img.  Get some sort of serial solution to
connect a dumb termial program with the ability to download raw/ascii
files.

The pi zero does not come with pins, you will want/need some way to
make the serial connection, if you can solder and get some header
pins great.  If not there are other ways, some pins can be shoved in
rather than soldered.  Or balanced if nothing else (stick them in and
lean them to the side so they touch), just dont short anything out.

On the sd card end of the board the P1 connector pins are like this,
same as other raspberry pi boards, but span the whole length of the
board rather than orentied more toward one corner than another.

The pins we care about

2
4
6
8  TX out
10 RX in

The pi TX goes to the uart RX and the pi RX to the uart TX.

Here are some examples of 3.3V level uarts, you need 3.3V level not 5V
definitely not RS-232C

You can find these on ebay from china for a buck or two each with a
jumper to select between 3.3V and 5V.

This bootloader is expecting motorola s-record formatted data.

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SREC_(file_format)

arm-whatever-objcopy --srec-forceS3 notmain.elf -O srec notmain.srec

It is specifically expecting S3 records

It only supports S0, S3, and S7 records.  You can certainly add more
support.

Using minicom you download by selecting ascii instead of xmodem
or kermit or whatever.  This just sends the file as is.  If using
some other terminal emulator you have to just figure it out.  Or
cut and paste it from an editor like the program above and paste
it into your dumb terminal window.

Minicom spawns other programs to do the downloads so there is or
can be a dead period after downloading before minicom receives data
so to deal with that once downloaded you press the letter g to go or
run the program.  This way you or at least I dont lose any characters
from the downloaded program.

I normally do not deliver binaries.  In this case I have left the
binary in the root directory as bootloader.img, copy this file to
your sd card and name it kernel.img.

Remove or rename a config.txt file on the sd card if you have one.

There are a pair of holes on the board labelled RUN.  If you are able
to solder or find other solutions (there are pins that can be pushed
into holes like this), you can put a momentary switch that when closed
will reset the board, and released allow it to boot again.  Then you
can use this bootloader again by simply pressing the reset button.
Much easier than power cycling the board every time (turning the power
off, then on by unplugging the usb).

These two lines in vectors.s determine the size of the programs this
can handle

First off 0x200000 is close to where this program begins so if you use
this bootloader for larger programs you will overwrite the bootloader
while running and crash.  Make that number larger.

.space 0x200000-0x8004,0

If you approach this number

skip:
    mov sp,#0x08000000

Where the stack lives for this program, then you need to move that up
as well.

Oh, and this line too, this limits the overall size of the program
if you run into this then just make it bigger as well.

    ram : ORIGIN = 0x8000, LENGTH = 0x1000000
