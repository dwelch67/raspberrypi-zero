This is a pi zero example

Using a start.elf committed to the raspberry pi repo on 2017-06-13
I wanted to examine the bootstrap placed by the GPU for the ARM before
releasing reset on the ARM.  I wasnt expecting this one to be all
that interesting and it isnt, the code for the raspberry pi 2 and
for the raspberry pi 3 is far more interesting a the cores are more
complicated and multicore.  But there still exists the possibility that
the foundation may change the bootcode or other items in this area.

I simply dumped the first 0x1000 bytes of memory which I had not
otherwise touched.  A number of ways to deal with it but an easy one is
to just make a pseudo assembly program with the data:

.word 0xE3A00000                                                                                 
.word 0xE59F1004                                                                                 
.word 0xE59F20E8                                                                                 
.word 0xE59FF0E8                                                                                 
.word 0x00000C42                                                                                 
.word 0x00000000                                                                                 
.word 0x00000000 
.word 0x00000000     
...

assemble then disassemble, we are relying here on the disassembler
to disassemble data as well as instructions, so we place data but
it disassembles them as instructions which was the goal.

google ATAG linux and find many hits on the topic

For example

www.simtec.co.uk/products/SWLINUX/files/booting_article.html

This is important:

The CPU must be in SVC (supervisor) mode with both IRQ and FIQ interrupts disabled.
The MMU must be off, i.e. code running from physical RAM with no translated addressing.
Data cache must be off
Instruction cache may be either on or off
CPU register 0 must be 0
CPU register 1 must be the ARM Linux machine type
CPU register 2 must be the physical address of the parameter list


and this

The list must be stored in RAM and placed in a region of memory where
neither the kernel decompresser nor initrd manipulation will overwrite
it. The recommended placement is in the first 16KiB of RAM, usually the
start of physical RAM plus 0x100 (which avoids zero page exception
vectors).

I predate DTB stuff but have only slightly dabbled in embedded linux
at this level.  The 0x100 offset is a compile time option as are some
other things and/or you just dont mess with it.

Clearly we can see that they are loading 0x8000 into the PC that is
how they run our program that was loaded at 0x8000.

Before the pis were avaiable to the masses from the info around at the
time the kernel.img was loaded at 0x0000 and would have needed to
include this bootloader stuff.  Normally you use redboot or u-boot
or other to load the kernel image into memory and place the ATAGs/DTB
and launch.  Linux (for ARM) is as you can see extremely trivial to boot
it does not require such massivly complicated bootloaders, those are
just projects that have gotten out of control, feature creep.  So
it was nice in one respect to have the linux kernel image bundled
with some bootstrap, but that was also unusual so by the time the
rest of us could get boards they had changed it to what it is today.
The GPU acts as the bootloader places the ATAGs and some bootstrap
code to load r0,r1,r2 and branch to 0x8000.

R2 is loaded with 0x00000000 so I assume that is what they add 0x100
to to get at the atags.

The ATAGs have this 0x5441xxxx pattern so I dumped those

00000104 54410001 
00000118 54410002 
00000128 54410009 

This is the data starting at offset 0x00000100

0x00000005 <--- how many words 
0x54410001 <--- ATAG_CORE
0x00000000 
0x00000000 
0x00000000 
0x00000004 <---- how many words
0x54410002 <---- ATAG_MEM
0x08000000 <---- size
0x00000000 <---- start
0x00000063 <---- how many words
0x54410009 <---- ATAG_CMDLINE

The command line length lookes wrong to me but clearly it works so
not going to worry about it.  Interesting items in the command line

vc_mem.mem_base=0xec00000
vc_mem.mem_size=0x10000000

See bootstrap.txt for a dump and disassembly of what I read out of
memory.

So the pi zero is advertised as having 512MBytes, which is 0x20000000
ATAG_MEM appears to be saying you have 128MBytes (for ARM linux) starting
at 0x00000000.  And the GPU/VC has 256MBytes starting at 0x0EC00000.
Is what it is...can be changed with config.txt if needed.

Good information to know and you can have your program read these
atags to find ATAG_MEM to know how deep into memory the GPU as of this
boot is willing to let you go.  You could wander into the GPUs data/code
and crash it so tread lightly.

This is a pi zero example, but when the same technique is used for the
pi2 or pi3 you can see how they are "sorting the cores" I call it.  My
limited knowledge of ARM cores (just look at the various ARM TRM's) the
edge of the core (where the chip vendor connects their logic) is a
clock enable and a reset for each core in a multicore processor which
means it is up to the vendor to decide how/when to release each core.
I dont yet know if broadcom has individual core controls, but what
we see is that all the cores seem to come up at or near the same time
if you put your code at address zero on these chips and assume it is
a uniprocessor, then the multiple cores will stomp on each other (try
to print out the uart, one to four of them will write to the data
register then start polling for an empty THR, then one or two will
get a write in and so on, you see repeated characters).  The ARM
documentation is vague or actually just has a gaping hole, as to the
values expected in the ID registers, so sorting the cores without
a single threaded way to "see" what is going on is tricky, disassembling
the raspberry pi placed bootstrap shows you how they sort the cores
and then each lands in a loop polling a "mailbox" register waiting for
it to contain a non-zero address indicating we want that core to
start running code there.   It also shows us for those platforms that
they are putting the cores in HYP mode instead of SVC (which violates
the ARM linux booting page I linked above but this has evolved since
that page).

But this is a pi zero example and you can see how crazy simple it is
to boot linux, u-boot and redboot are gross overkill.
